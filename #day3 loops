# simple for loop program without range

    print(fruits)

# for loop program with range but with not parameters 
# remember the range will start from 0 and will exclude the number mentioned in brackets eg.11
for i in range(11): 
    print(i)

# for loop program with range and also with parameters 
# remember the firt parameter is start and last parameter is ending point 
# if only parameter is mentioned then it is the ending point 
for j in range (1,10):

# while loop example 
b  = 1

#1.break(terminate the entire flow of the code after the condition i satisfied)

# 2.continue(terminate only the condition and the rest of the code maintain it flow)
